NASA's new spacecraft Orion appears to be all set for a launch this December 4, what’s even better is that NASA is inviting public to send their names, which will be etched onto a microchip, to travel around several destinations from Low-Earth orbits to even Mars. The [portal](http://go.usa.gov/vcpz) is open till October 31st, so go grab your boarding pass.

Yes, they are giving away Boarding Passes to everyone till October 31st, as you can see I've got mine. The best part is that all names submitted will fly on Orion and accrue miles as part of the 'frequent flier' campaign. Awesome!

All these are great initiative by NASA, it's fantastic to know that astronauts are not going the Tim Dodd way.

But before you go ahead and give you names, it's always good to know about the program.

## NASA's Orion spacecraft

It is the next generation spacecraft capable of taking astronauts **deeper into the space** than any other spacecraft. It is designed to withstand the harshest of temperatures, speed and extreme radiation.

It looks like to get everything right these machines has to be tested, and even though there were several other forms of minor testing, a fully-fledged take-off plus landing and everything that comes in between has to be recorded and verified before a human is put on this beast!

### Exploration Flight Test-1

So they are planning for the first test flight, designated **Exploration Flight Test-1** on December 4. In short it will be a big treat, especially for all those data scientists as getting data from a 4.5-hour, two-orbit mission around Earth is pretty awesome!

For its first flight, it will not have any astronauts in it. All sensors aboard will record and monitor all the activities and surroundings of the Orion spacecraft.

**Launch**
Orion will act as the payload for DELTA IV HEAVY rocket, a pretty dope machine. This will take it 100 miles (~160 Km) at 17,000 miles/h (~27,360 Km/h), from there the Orion is ejected into its orbit. Perfecto!

**Flying in Space**
After its first orbit, it fires again for another big climb to 3600 miles (~5795 Km) above earth (15x higher than ISS).

It then passes through [Van Allen belt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt), this happens twice. A definitive test for all the electronics equipment on board and its radiation shielding capabilities.

**Re-entry**
Orion's jets fire to get it back to Earth. At 75 miles (~120 Km) above Earth it speeds up at 20,000 miles/h (~32,185 Km/h), this surrounds the vehicle with hot plasma. At 4000°F (~2204°C), its twice as hot as a molten lava, no data can penetrate the plasma causing to loose communication. On board jets keeps the ship pointed correctly, so that the insulation shield gets hold of the heat, largest of its kind.

**Landing**
Its lands/splashes into the Pacific Ocean after a set of 3 parachute deployment, the final one being the size of an American football field reduces the speed to 20 miles/h (~32 Km/h).

## Is this the Future?

The immense amount of data that this machine will have will most possibly change the way we do space travel, the reading are critical and have to be analyzed to create a future perspective on these endeavors.

I can definitely see a bright future, us conquering the depth of Mars and I'm hoping this as just the beginning. All I can say is that there are several wicked projects out there trying for a chunk of the mighty space exploration.

India was successful with its Mangalyaan program, delivering a budget satellite system to Mars (Mangalyaan took only 1/10th in budget of a similar NASA project). The crazy one I’ve seen so far is the Dutch program, [one-way mission to Mars](http://www.mars-one.com/news/press-releases/mars-one-starts-its-search-for-the-first-humans-on-mars).

For now I'm not planning to invade Mars, so I guess my name on a microchip with NASA's Orion should take me to places. Hell yeah! Imma gonna do some space exploration.

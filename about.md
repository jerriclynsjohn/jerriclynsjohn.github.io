Anything that I can trash out from my brain about programming, technology, gadgets, travel and life can be found here

## Find some samples:

* Sample `code`.
* Comments powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com).
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for a better social sharing experience.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting]({{ site.url }}/code-highlighting-post/) to make the code examples look snazzy

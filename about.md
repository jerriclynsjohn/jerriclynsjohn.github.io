I call myself an "Experienced dreamer and self proclaimed rocket scientist", its contradictory and not so true. SwiftJuggler, a pathetic name that I came up for my blog can be thought of as a name given to a brain dump of everything programming, technology, design, travel, life and more. 

I have no intension of maintaining a standard in my blog nor will I censor my thought for anything except those that I think should absolutely be kept down. Keeping a separate blog for technology and another for life are for those who have them separated in life, so until I separate them you will see a wildly messy collection of blog posts. 

I love history, art, music and food. Religion is a subject I'm researching with no intension to stand against any but with all intensions to study about what they could have done better. My love for art and creativity was something that I cherished from my childhood, any modest attempts of creative works that I made has nothing significant as compared to the inspiration that I get in life from other's significant creative works. Trying to understand history and evolution is something most humans do, and I guess I do it too. Food being mostly associated with menus , has got me to love it only for my basic human instinct.

Finding the significant other is also obviously my basic human instinct, something that I once failed significantly and got me curiously wondering if I ever will be able to maintain something this complex. Complexity has gone down with my recent affiliation with another and I'm hopeful that I learn the intricacies involved in maintaining it. Keeping up with mom & brother, six aunties, six uncles, thirteen cousins, one niece, other branched out relatives and friends is something I enjoy doing in life.

So where does technology come in my life, well "blending technology and life" is a dream that I cofounded with my friend. I always think about it as one medium that can change humanity and nature. I make sure everything I do with it, adds up to it. 

I guess, `SwiftJuggler` was not a pathetic name after all. :-)
